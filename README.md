This is a Reactjs project bootstrapped with create-react-app.
# Getting Started
First, run the development server:

# npm run 
 or
# yarn start
 or
# pnpm start
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.jsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.js.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.
